## Submission Instructions

### Overview

The idea for my project came from the company where my wife works.  My wife works for a small belting company consisting of less
than 20 employees that makes and sells conveyor belts for manufacturing and food processing plants.  As their sales and company
started to grow, they found themselves in need of a better system for tracking inventory.  This gave me the idea to create a program
to track inventory, customers, and sales orders.  This program would benefit the users by acurately tracking inventory on hand, sales, 
and customer information.  From the dashboard, users will be able to quickly see at a glance the top selling belts, top customers ranked by sales, etc.
Inventory will automatically be updated when a sales order is entered into the system, and the inventoy levels will alert the user when more product needs
to be ordered.

### Features

This application will have the following features:
1. User login:  Users will have to log into the system to access the inventory system.  Users will have different levels of access to the system based on
                their job description.
2. Depending on the user's job function, users will be able to add inventory to the system, create orders, add customers, and add new products to the system.
3. All CRUD operations will be availabe in this application depending on user roles.
